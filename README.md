Simple Python Ransomware

This is a simple educational ransomware project designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It encrypts files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in CTR mode, making the data unreadable until decrypted with the correct key.
 This project is strictly for educational purposes. Using this code for malicious activities is illegal and punishable by law. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this software.

---

- Encrypts a file using the AES algorithm.
- Deletes the original file after encryption.
- Saves the encrypted file with a `.crypto` extension.
- Includes a decryption script to restore the encrypted files.

---

- **Python**: Main programming language used for the project.
- **PyAES**: Library for implementing AES encryption.

---

- `encrypter.py`: Main script for encrypting files.
- `decrypter.py`: Script for decrypting files using the same key.

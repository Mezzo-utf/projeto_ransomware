# Simple Python Ransomware 🛡️

This is a simple educational ransomware project designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It encrypts files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in CTR mode, making the data unreadable until decrypted with the correct key.

⚠️ **WARNING:** This project is strictly for educational purposes. Using this code for malicious activities is illegal and punishable by law. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this software.
